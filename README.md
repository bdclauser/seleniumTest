# Selenium UI Testing Project using Selenium WebDriver and Python

This project is designed to test the user interface (UI) of a web application using the Selenium automation tool with Python programming language. The purpose of this README is to provide instructions for installing and running the Selenium UI tests.

## Prerequisites

To run the Selenium UI tests, you will need:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge installed on your computer
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- Selenium WebDriver for Python installed on your computer
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x on your computer by following the instructions provided [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install `pip install pipenv` from the command line to install pipenv.

3. Install Selenium WebDriver for Python by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```python
pip install selenium
```  

4. Download and install the appropriate web driver for your browser:
    - Google Chrome: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
    - Mozilla Firefox: [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
    - Microsoft Edge: [EdgeDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

ChromeDriver and geckodriver mustbe installed on the [system path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

5. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

6. Open the project in your code editor or IDE.

## WebDriver SetUp for Windows

To Install ChromeDriver and geckodriver on Windows

1. Create a folder named C:\Selenium.
2. Move the executables into this folder.
3. Add this folder to the Path environment variable. (See [How to Add to Windows PATH Environment Variable](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/).)

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to execute the test file:

```python
python test_file.py
```  
_Note: Replace "test_file.py" with the name of your test file._

3. The tests will run in your browser and the results will be displayed in the console.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, you should be able to install and run Selenium WebDriver for Python and execute the Selenium UI tests on your web application. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to refer to the Selenium documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
